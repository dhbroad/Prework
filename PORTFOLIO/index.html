                <strong><small>You'll never know where life will take you. -Feb 6th, 2022</small></strong>

                <p>I was introduced to coding in college while studying engineering. It was an intimidating concept and no matter what I did throughout the class, 
                    things just didn't quite click. There were a few students who obviously had some coding experience that accelled in the course and it seemed
                     like they could get their code to anything with ease. I chocked it up to them just having a different ability to understand how to use code and 
                     that it just wasn't my thing. Little did I know that throughout my career, I would be put in situation after situation that lead me back 
                     to using coding approaches to solve problems.
                    </p>
                <p>The tech industry only continues to grow as a whole and more of the world is being connected by the internet of things. In the past couple years, I've
                    found myself watching more and more content that goes into the behind the scenes of how things are coded and it has really gotten me interested in learning
                    more on my own. I have a number of friends at church that started talking about coding bootcamps and sharing their experiences with them. Everything they had to say
                    was positive and it sounded like a challenge I'd be up for. So far, with the great resources and tutorials that coding camps offer to prepare you, I've been able to get 
                    to a level of understanding that college me would be jealous of. Now it's time to dig in and get to work on becoming a full time developer with Coding Temple!

                <p>From my short time practicing coding and web development, I've already started to imagine what I could possibly do with all of the tools and resources at my fingertips.
                    I hope to come out of Coding Temple with some of my ideas becoming reality, the expertise to continue to grow as a developer, the understanding to teach others, and
                    the ability to use my creativity to build useful applications for years to come.
